    <h3>The CGT Perspective on CIT</h3>
    <p class = p1>While my major is mainly CGT and with a focus on Multimedia, I am required to take a website design class. With saying that however,
    I do enjoy the simplicity and ease of use with designing stuff frome tags and coding to an extent. Never quite understood flexbox, but hoperfully this semester
    I will finally get it. Coding works just as well for building a website froms scratch just as much as any wesbite builder much like wordpress.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finally understand how flexbox and flex in general works</li>
        <li>Expand my web design skills even more working with group members</li>
        <li>Pass the semester with a good project to show off to recruiters. </li>
      </ul>
